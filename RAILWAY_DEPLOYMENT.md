# Railway Deployment Guide for TeamPulse Turbo

## Overview
This project is now fully configured for Railway deployment with proper error handling, environment variable management, and demo mode functionality.

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Server Configuration
- âœ… Added proper CORS configuration for Railway domains
- âœ… Fixed import/export statements throughout the codebase
- âœ… Added missing route imports in `server.js`
- âœ… Implemented graceful OpenAI API key handling (demo mode when missing)
- âœ… Fixed login-first routing (redirects to `/login.html` on root)

### 2. API Endpoints
- âœ… Added missing `/api/salary-employee` endpoint
- âœ… Added missing `/api/salary-text` endpoint  
- âœ… Fixed route mounting for analyze and salary routes
- âœ… Implemented demo data when OpenAI API is unavailable

### 3. Environment Variables
- âœ… Created `.env.example` with all required variables
- âœ… Added environment validation with fallbacks
- âœ… Configurable demo credentials via env vars

### 4. Railway Configuration Files
- âœ… `railway.json` - Railway service configuration
- âœ… `nixpacks.toml` - Build configuration for Nixpacks
- âœ… Updated `package.json` with proper scripts and engine requirements

### 5. Error Handling & Linting
- âœ… Fixed ESLint configuration for browser globals
- âœ… Resolved unused variable warnings
- âœ… Added proper error boundaries for missing dependencies

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Railway Setup
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Railway
2. Create a new Railway project
3. Connect to your repository

### 2. Environment Variables
Set these in Railway dashboard:
```
NODE_ENV=production
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here (optional - demo works without)
DEMO_USERNAME=admin (optional - defaults to 'admin')
DEMO_PASSWORD=password123 (optional - defaults to 'password123')
```

### 3. Build Configuration
Railway will automatically:
- Use Node.js 18+ (specified in `package.json`)
- Run `npm install` and `npm run build`
- Start server with `npm start`
- Health check via `/health` endpoint

## Demo Mode Features
When OPENAI_API_KEY is not provided:
- âœ… Negotiation analysis returns structured demo results
- âœ… Salary analysis generates random but realistic data
- âœ… Employee analysis provides mock market data
- âœ… All UI features remain functional

## Authentication
- Default login: `admin` / `password123`
- Redirects unauthenticated users to login page
- Can be customized via environment variables

## Health Check
- Available at `/health`
- Returns server status, uptime, and version
- Used by Railway for service monitoring

## File Structure
```
â”œâ”€â”€ server.js              # Main server file with all routes
â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ analyze.js         # Negotiation analysis (with demo mode)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ salary.js          # Salary analysis (with demo mode)  
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ login.html         # Login page (shown first)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html         # Main application
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app.js             # Frontend logic
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ salary-analysis.js # Salary analysis frontend
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/                 # Utility functions
â”œâ”€â”€ middleware/            # Express middleware
â”œâ”€â”€ railway.json           # Railway configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ nixpacks.toml          # Build configuration
â””â”€â”€ .env.example           # Environment template
```

## Production Notes
- Server binds to `0.0.0.0:$PORT` for Railway compatibility
- CORS configured for Railway domains (`*.railway.app`)
- Helmet security middleware with Railway-compatible settings
- 50MB request limit for file uploads
- Graceful shutdown handling for Railway deployments

## Troubleshooting
1. **Build fails**: Check Node.js version (requires 18+)
2. **Routes not working**: Verify all imports in `server.js`
3. **CORS errors**: Check Railway domain in CORS config
4. **API not working**: Demo mode activates when OpenAI key missing

The project is now fully ready for Railway deployment! ðŸš€
